Before starting the virtual machine containing AHRL, go into the virtual 
machine settings and click on "Display". Where it says "graphics controller",
choose VMSVGA. Also choose 128MB of video memory, and one monitor. Click "OK".

Now, boot AHRL in the virtual machine you just configured.  Login and see the
default desktop.

From the top left corner, click the blue circle icon, which brings up the menu.
  * Menu-> Settings -> Display
  * Pick the desired resolution from the "Resolution" menu

This works on AHRL v25.

Have fun and 73,
