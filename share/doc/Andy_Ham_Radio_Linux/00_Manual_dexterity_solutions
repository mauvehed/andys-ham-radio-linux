From Andy (KB1OIQ):

I have friends with manual dexterity issues.  Their hands just aren't as steady
as they were in their younger days.  Sometimes, these issues are caused by
ailments such as Parkinson's disease.

Then, there are those with eyesight issues, where larger fonts and larger icons 
would be of great benefit.  While easier to see, these settings cause graphical
elements to be larger and perhaps easier to hit with the mouse pointer.

Another issue is those exceedingly small areas on the edge of the window.  It 
is very difficult for many people to line the mouse up on the window's edge
in order to resize the window.

Many of these issues are exacerbated by the very high resolution monitors
that exist today.  Each time we get a new monitor, everything seems to get
smaller.

My friends with these issues have asked me what can be done in Andy's Ham Radio
Linux (AHRL) to make it easier for them to use.  I've collected some ideas for
the xfce versions of AHRL (v23a and greater). 

a) In the Settings menu, choose Appearance.  There are 4 tabs:
       * Style    - pick a color scheme that is to your liking
       * Icons    - pick an icon style that is pleasing to you
       * Fonts    - change both the "Default Font" and the "Default Monospace Font" to
                    a larger size (try 14 for starters)
       * Settings - one can change the Toolbar Style here, but I'm not sure
                    it helps

b) Moving/resizing a window - there are several possibilities:
     * Resizing a window:
 
       * Move the mouse cursor to any place in a window that you'd like to resize
       * press ALT-F8 on your keyboard
       * the mouse cursor will jump to the lower right corner of the window
       * move the mouse to resize the window
       * click the left mouse button when finished

    * Moving a window
       * Move the mouse cursor to any place in a window that you'd like to move
       * Press and hold the ALT key while pressing the left mouse button
       * Move the mouse until the window is at the desired location
       * Let go of the left mouse button and the ALT key

    * Another way to resize a window
       * Move the mouse cursor to any place in a window that you'd like to resize
       * Press and hold the ALT key while pressing the RIGHT mouse button
       * Move the mouse until the window is the desired size
       * Notice that the location of the mouse cursor determines the direction
         in which the window is resized (horizontal, vertical, both)

c) Place commonly used menu items directly onto the desktop.  The desktop icon
   is likely to be larger than the equivalent menu item.

    * Go into the menu and place the mouse cursor onto a frequently used program
    * Instead of clicking quickly with the left mouse button, press and hold
      the left mouse button.
    * While continuing to press the left mouse button, move the mouse cursor
      and drop the item onto the background.
    * An icon should appear - double click that icon, and the desired program
      will be executed.
    * If a popup window appears, click "Mark Executable".  This will only be
      necessary the very first time.

d) Another issue for many people is that the window's title bar is too small,
   and the buttons which minimize, maximize, roll up, and terminate are also too
   small.  I believe these are collectively called "window decorations".  There's
   a way to modify the size of these objects:

    * In the menu, choose Settings -> Window Manager.
    * Click the first tab on the left which says "Style".
    * Choose a theme that creates the window decorations of the desired size.
      Examples:  Default-hdpi, Default-xhdpi, and Greybird-accessibility
    * If you don't like the available choices, install additional themes
      and see if you can find one to your liking.  

e) The desktop icons which launch applications are too small.
    * Follow this procedure to change the size of the desktop icons
    * Go to the menu and choose: Settings -> Desktop.
    * Click the third tab: Icons
    * Change the Icon size to something larger, perhaps 72.
    * Change this value until the icons are the desired size.
    * You might also choose to check the box next to this item:
      Single click to activate items (no more double clicking!)

If you have helpful suggestions, please send them to me, so I can add them to
this list.  Thanks, and 73!
