HOWTO JS8Call
=============

JS8Call is under development as of this writing.  The software will
expire, forcing the user to upgrade to a new version.  The version
installed here has perhaps expired, and you're wondering what to do.

First, download the most recent copy from here:
    https://groups.io/g/js8call/wiki/Download-Links

You'll want to look in the Linux section of that website, and 
download the *.deb file for Ubuntu 18.04 for a 64-bit computer.

The filename will be SIMILAR to this:
    js8call_1.0.0_18.04_amd64.deb

Remember the directory into which this file was downloaded.

From a terminal window, do the following as root, and BE CAREFUL.  Note
that you'll need to substitute the name of the directory, and the proper
file name.  If you type this verbatim, it won't work.  If you're filled
with uncertainty, stop now.

    sudo dpkg --remove js8call
    sudo mv <dir>/js8call_<whatever>.deb /usr/local/tarballs
    sudo dpkg -i /usr/local/tarballs/js8call_<whatever>.deb
    which js8call

The output from the "which js8call" command should be:
    /usr/bin/js8call

If so, and if there were no errors from the "dpkg -i" command, you
might be on your way to success!

If you received a lot of errors about unresolved dependencies, you
should probably elect to stop.  Resolving dependencies can be painful.  
It is also possible that you've downloaded the wrong *.deb file for 
your system.

If all is well, try it:  js8call

If the JS8Call window appears on your screen, you have succeeded!
Congratulations!
