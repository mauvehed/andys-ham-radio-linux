To create the /usr/local/src/tinySA_pve, follow the instructions
in the HOW_Andy_Setup_nanoVNA-saver.pdf file, but use the command above
to get the tinySA-saver software from github.

The user shouldn't need to recreate the python virtual environment.
One exists in /usr/local/src.

When plugged in and turned on, the tinySA should appear as /dev/ttyACM0.
The user needs to be the dialout group.
