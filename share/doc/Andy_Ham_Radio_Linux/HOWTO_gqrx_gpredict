HOWTO use gqrx and gpredict together, and why
=============================================

gqrx can be used to tune in a satellite transmission,  but does not compensate
for doppler shift.  One could attempt to compensate manually by following the
signal on the waterfall, but there is a different way.

gpredict knows all about satellites and doppler shift.  It also knows how to
control a radio, such as gqrx.  If both programs are run simultaneously, 
gpredict can send frequency adjustment commands to gqrx to compensate for 
doppler shift.  Magic!  

Here is what I did, and it worked well for me.

* Start the gqrx program, and tune it to the frequency of the desired 
  satellite.  Set the mode in the receiver options tab.  Confirm the
  satellite's frequency on the internet.  I've seen cases where the
  TLE file (for gpredict) disagrees with the frequency posted on the internet.
  If unsure, be prepared to try both frequencies, or carefully observer
  the waterfall during the satellite pass.

* Start the gpredict program.  Setup the software so that the desired satellite
  is shown in the current module.  Press the button in the module that looks
  like a downarrow inside of a square box.  This will bring up a menu (I'll
  call it the module drop down menu) in which "Radio Control" is to be selected.
  If a popup appears indicating that a radio needs to be configured, do so as
  follows.

* Configuring a radio in gpredict - go to the Edit -> Preferences menu.
  Select interfaces, and choose the "Radios" tab.  Then, click "Add New".
  For the name, I choose "gqrx".  Be sure to set the port to 7356.  It must
  match the port number in the gqrx remote control port settings.  I left
  the other settings at their default values.  Click OK when finished.

* In gpredict, in the module drop down menu, choose "Radio Control".
  Select the target satellite, and verify the correct downlink frequency.
  Click "Track".  Notice on the uplink side of the window that there 
  is now a device called "gqrx".  Click "Engage".

* In gqrx, there is a GUI button to "configure remote control settings".
  Click that button and verify that the "listen on port" number 
  (7356 by default) matches the port number that was configured into 
  gpredict.  Also, be sure to add 127.0.0.1 as an allowed host.  Click
  OK when finished.

* Lastly, in gqrx, click the GUI button to enable remote control via
  TCP.  The button will stay depressed, indicating that remote control
  has been enabled.

* Go back to gpredict and verify that the "Engage" button is still pressed.

* Lastly, go to gqrx and see that the frequency is changing perhaps once 
  per second, under control of gpredict.

* Congratulations!  I hope this has worked for you.  If not, please
  go through the instructions again.  It is also possible that something
  in your situation is different from mine, requiring a minor adjustment.
  It is my hope that these instructions have gotten you close to the
  solution for you.

* To "break the connection", click the gqrx button that enabled remote
  control via TCP.  The button will no longer look depressed, and that
  should also cause the "Engage" button in gpredict to no longer be
  selected.

Have a lot of fun, and 73,
