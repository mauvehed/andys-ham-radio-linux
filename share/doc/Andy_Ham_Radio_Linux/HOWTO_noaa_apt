HOWTO receive NOAA APT weather satellite images
===============================================

1) The correct antenna is very important!  I built a quadrifilar helix antenna
   with the encouragement of my friend John (G3BVU SK).  Other types of antennas
   could also be used.

2) Start the gqrx program and tune it near the satellite frequency.  I use the
   bookmarks feature of gqrx, but gpredict could also be used to control the
   frequency in gqrx (due to doppler shift).  I recommend using gpredict and gqrx
   together.

3) In gqrx, the satellite transmission is a "narrow FM" signal which requires
   a filter width of 40 kHz.  Be sure to set this manually prior to receiving
   the satellite signal.

4) When AOS begins, be sure that the frequency, mode, and filter width are correct.
   Press the "Rec" button in the audio tab of gqrx.  This will create a wav
   formatted audio file.  During AOS, listen for the characteristic tones
   associated with the transmission.  When LOS occurs, press the "Rec" button
   again to close the wav file.

5) The wav file recorded by gqrx needs to be converted into a format acceptable
   to atpdec.  The sox program will do this easily:
   For example:  sox input.wav output.wav channels 1 rate 11025

   sox gqrx_output.wav sox_output.wav channels 1 rate 11025

6) To view the received image, start the atpdec program.  Open the wav file that
   was just created by sox.  The atpdec software will put the image into the
   directory specified by "-d".

   atpdec -s 18 -i ab sox_output.wav -d images

7) Alternatively, one could use these GUI based programs, both of which can
   be found in the Satellites menu:

   * xwxapt - be sure to do these preliminary steps:
     * mkdir ~/xwxapt
     * cp /usr/local/share/xwxapt/xwxaptrc ~/xwxapt/
     * Then, run xwxapt, either from the menu or the command line

   * noaa-apt
