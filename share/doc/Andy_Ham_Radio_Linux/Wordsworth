Increase Your CW Speed with Wordsworth
======================================

George (K1IG) won the QST Cover Plaque for the May 2017 edition
with his article, "Increase Your CW Speed with Wordsworth", found
on page 74 of that magazine.

George (K1IG) had the idea to learn morse code in a different way. To
improve ragchewing, listen to an entire word at the normal speed, and
leave extra spaces between words. Teach the mind to interpret words
without mentally spelling them. George coined the expression "wordsworth",
partly as a play on "Farnsworth", but also as a pun, since we're trying
to learn to mentally process a word's worth of information at a time.

Andy (KB1OIQ) wrote two simple Perl scripts to help with this idea. One
script creates a list of words which come from several different built-in
lists. The second script takes any text as input, strips out certain
punctuation, and then adds spacing between the words. Cut/paste either
of these into Fldigi, and have it create the CW sounds while you listen
and train your mind in a new way.

One could use text from Project Gutenberg, for example, as input to the script.

Learning CW via the Wordsworth Method
=====================================

George (K1IG) has come up with a different way to learn CW (morse code).  He
calls it the "Wordsworth" method.  

"Farnsworth" is the method many people use, where additional space is placed
between individual letters.

"Wordsworth" is a method where the additional space is placed after each word.
There is no extra space placed between the letters.  This distinguishes this
method from the "Farnsworth" method.

In the military, where many people learned CW, the skill of writing or typing
a character at a time *accurately* was very important!  Often, CW transmissions
were encoded, so learning words was irrelevant.  "HALWAL", that is, hear a
letter, write a letter, may be OK for callsigns, but falls apart under these
conditions:

a) neither a writing instrument nor paper are available
b) when the CW speed exceeds one's ability to write it down

Comprehension often doesn't occur until one reads that which has been written,
which slows down the natural flow of the communication.

Today, learning "HALWAL" may not be the most helpful for people who are
interested in ragchewing.  A different method is thus proposed:  Wordsworth.

Consider what we did when learning English, perhaps as a young child:

a) learned how to recognize, say, and draw each letter of the alphabet
b) put the letters together into simple words, e.g. "Hop on Pop"
c) read individual words in a sentence
d) comprehend the sentence as a whole, where thoughts and ideas pops into
   our heads

How does this apply to the Wordsworth Method:

a) one must still learn each letter individually and at a reasonable speed
   (e.g. 15 WPM) before the Wordsworth Method can be applied.

b) put additional spaces between words

c) mentally copy words as a group, **without** spelling the letters in your head

d) eventually, the listener's brain acclimates to this and the sentences and meanings
   appear in one's head, just like when listening to someone speak the language

How can this be accomplished?

a) two Perl scripts have been supplied:  gen_cw_words.pl and text_to_cw.pl

b) these Perl scripts have been tested on Linux but should work in any operating
   system that supports Perl

c) the scripts are designed to be used from the command line

gen_cw_words.pl
===============

Generate words for CW practice.  There are lists of words built into this script.
  - CW words, such as 73, CQ, SK
  - common English 2-letter words
  - common English 3-letter words
  - common English 4-letter words
  - individual English letters/numbers
  - list of names

The code is trivially simple so please modify it to meet your needs!

Command line:
  ./gen_cw_words.pl -h or --help

                    -n or --num     number of words to generate
                                    defaults to 50

                    -r or --repeat  number of times to repeat each word
                                    defaults to 1

                    -l or --list    list from which to choose the words
                                    e.g. letter, cw, name, two, three, four

  The output goes to STDOUT, but one could redirect it to a file, or pipe
  it to another command (more on that shortly).

text_to_cw.pl
=============

This script massages words into something useful for CW practice.  First,
punctuation uncommon to CW is removed.  Then, spacing is added between
each word as described for the Wordsworth Method.

Command line:
  ./text_to_cw.pl --help
                  --input <infile>  file containing text to process
                                    if not specified, defaults to STDIN
                  --spaces <n>      number of spaces to put between each word

  Input can come from STDIN or a file.  Output goes to STDOUT, but one can
  redirect it to a file if desired.

Usage Examples
==============

./gen_cw_words.pl -l cw -r 3 -n 5
QRZ QRZ QRZ CUL CUL CUL TEMP TEMP TEMP YRS YRS YRS QRM QRM QRM 

./gen_cw_words.pl -l name -r 2 -n 6
Vlad Vlad John John Mike Mike Gary Gary Bob Bob Tim Tim 

./gen_cw_words -l cw -r 3 -n 3 | ./text_to_cw -s 3
QRQ   QRQ   QRQ   PSE   PSE   PSE   WATT   WATT   WATT   

cat Pride_and_prejudice.txt | ./text_to_cw -s 3 | head -20
<lots of text appears>

The Last Step
=============

Now that lots of practice words can be generated, cut/paste those words
from your terminal into the Fldigi program.

1) Start up Fldigi

2) Change the Op_Mode to CW

3) Paste the text into the transmit window

4) Set the desired CW speed (lower left corner of the Fldigi GUI)

5) Press the TX macro key and listen to the CW sounds from your speaker.

6) Put your mind into a calm state (even close your eyes).  Don't force
   yourself to comprehend, just let the code flow into your ears and into
   your mind.  Try to hear words, not letters.  Break the habit of spelling
   words in your mind!

7) This takes lots of practice, but soon your mind will recognize common 
   words like: CQ, 73, SK, the, name, qth, rig, ant, rst

George (K1IG) came up with this idea and presented it to me.  Andy (KB1OIQ) 
wrote the Perl scripts and has been practicing with this method.

I (Andy) am improving but still need a lot more practice.  My goal is to
ragchew with "head copy" only.

Thanks, and 73,

George (K1IG)
