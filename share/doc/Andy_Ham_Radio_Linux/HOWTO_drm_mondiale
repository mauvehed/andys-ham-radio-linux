HOWTO listen to a DRM (digital radio mondiale) station
======================================================

1) Start gqrx and tune to an appropriate station.  The station is USB and 
   requires a filter 10kHz wide.  Line up the cursor with the left edge of
   the rectangular waterfall image of the signal.

2) Start the dream program.
   (Menu->Amateur Radio->SDR->Dream)

3) Start the pavucontrol program.
   (Menu->Utilities->Sound->pavucontrol)

4) In the dream program, View->Evaluation Dialog, which will bring up
   the System Evaluation window.  In the chart selector, look at the
   Input PSD.  Watch the DC Frequency of DRM signal and be sure that it is
   close to 5000 Hz (or maybe just a little bit below).  The SNR needs to be
   at least 16.0 dB in my experience.  If the MSC CRC indicator is red, the
   signal may not be tuned correctly, or perhaps insufficiently strong.
   In gqrx, sometimes this can be remedied by boosting the signal by 
   increasing the LNA gain in the input controls tab.

5) In the pavucontrol program:
   a) in the input devices tab, set the internal microphone volume to zero
      for both left and right channels
   b) in the playback tab, notice that gqrx and the dream receiver are both
      shown.  The gqrx audio output is set for "simultaneous output to built-in
      audio analog stereo".  The dream receiver audio output is set for 
      "build-in audio analog stereo.
   c) in the recording tab, the dream receiver should be getting its input
      from "monitor source of simultaneous output to built-in analog
      audio stereo"

6) In the dream program, go to the Settings menu:
   a) Settings -> Sound Card -> Signal Input -> Device -> combined_monitor
   b) Settings -> Sound Card -> Audio Output -> Device -> default

7) Play with the volume controls in pavucontrl, and the audio gain in the gqrx
   program.  With everything set correctly, one should hear the digital
   radio mondiale broadcast.

8) These were the settings on my computer.  Your sound card may have different
   settings.

9) Many thanks to Alex (OZ9AEC) Csete for pointing me in the right direction.
