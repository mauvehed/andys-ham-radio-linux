HOWTO receive WEFAX transmissions
=================================

1) Setup gqrx to receive the WEFAX transmission.  The transmission is a USB
   transmission requiring a filter width of 5 kHz.  The red line in grqx should
   be at the left edge of the WEFAX signal, which looks like a rectangle in the
   waterfall.  The filter should cover the entire signal.  The frequency in gqrx
   should be set 1.9 kHz lower than the carrier frequency.

2) Start the flgidi program and select "Op Mode" "WEFAX".

3) In fldigi, go to the Configure -> Modems -> Wfx menu

4) Setup the fax images destination directory.  I also prefer the 
   "Embedded Wefax Gui" option.

5) Start the pavucontrol program (Menu -> Utilities -> Sound -> PAvucontrol).

6) Configure the audio such that the gqrx output is sent to the fldigi input.
   (This can be somewhat involved, and is described in another document).

7) With the volume controls set properly, there will be signals displayed in the
   fldigi waterfall.  When receiving the WEFAX transmission, there will be two
   stripes shown in the fldigi waterfall.  fldigi will automatically adjust itself
   to align its tuning with these waterfall stripes.

8) I have found the following fldigi settings helpful:
   * FIR narrow
   * Click "Non stop" to start decoding anytime during the transmission
   * if the alignment of the image is incorrect, adjust it but be careful, since
     I have occasionally crashed fldigi in so doing
   * to compensate for the sound card clock, one may need to set a value
     in the "align" adjustment

9) One should see a black and white image appear in fldigi.  When the image
   transmission is complete, fldigi will save the image in the directory
   configured in an earlier step.

10) One could similarly decode other transmissions with gqrx and fldigi coupled
    together in this manner.  I have successfully decoded CW and RTTY.
    Experiment!

Have a lot of fun, and 73,
