HOWTO M17
=========

0) Run /usr/local/bin/init_m17client_config_dir to create $HOME/.config/m17client.
   This script will also copy /usr/local/share/m17client/*.ini into that directory.
   Obviously, only run this script the VERY FIRST time.

In the Digital_Modes -> M17 Menu:
  * M17 Client
  * M17 GUI
  * M17 TS
  * mvoice
  * droidstar
